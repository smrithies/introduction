Guidelines to follow while writing a professionalemail.
=======================================================

=> Include a clear, direct, short subject line so that recipient will be able to understand content of email faster and open it.
=> Creating message:
> Begin with a greeting and for that use proper professional salutation(use either Hi or Hello).
> First make a clear picture of purpose of email in beginning of the message.
> Now move on to main text of the email and make sure that sentences are short and clear. Avoid spelling and grammar mistakes.
> Before ending the email if prefer we can add some closing remarks like thanking the recipient.
> End the email with appropriate closing along with name.(Thank you or sincerely can be used).
